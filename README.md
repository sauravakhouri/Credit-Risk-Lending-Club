# Credit-Score-Lending-Club
 A Machine Learning Project enabling the banks to determine the creditworthiness of a person or a small, owner-operated business.
 
 # Objective: 
 To enable financial instituitons, banks and lenders to determine the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations and come up with different strategies to minimize loss.
